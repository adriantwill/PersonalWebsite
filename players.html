            2020 draft selections, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell, each signed 4 year contracts at $120M and $112M respectivly today.   
            Both engines of the lions offense had their best season in 2023 and Brad Holmes certinely wanted to sign them sooner rather than later.
            $77 of St. Brown's contract is guarenteed, who is one of the leagues best slot recievers and had the 3rd most yards(1,515) and receptions(119).
            Sewell recived $85 million guarenteed after taking another step up this year, espcially as a run blocker, with a 93.1 run blocking grade according to PFF.
