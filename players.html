            2020 draft selections, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell, each signed 4 year contracts at $120M and $112M respectively today.   
            Both engines of the lions offense had their best season in 2023 and Brad Holmes certainly wanted to sign them sooner rather than later.
            $77 of St. Brown's contract is guaranteed, who is one of the leagues best slot receivers and had the 3rd most yards(1,515) and receptions(119).
            Sewell received $85 million guaranteed after taking another step up this year, especially as a run blocker, with a 93.1 run blocking grade according to PFF.
