            The 2024 NFL draft was the most exciting selection since 2021 given the amount of blue chip talent at high value positions. 
            Here, are in my opinion, some of the most interesting storylines regarding the picks after the top 10.
            Laiatu Latu at 15 sets a record for the latest a defensive player has been selected, previously coming from 2021 with Jaycee horn at 8.
            This allowed the Colts and Seahawks to acquire top notch value at positions that didn't seem likely coming into Thursday night, while then addressing those needs with their next pick.
            Latu is one of the most technically refined pass rushers in the past few years and Murhpy is a dual threat defensive tackle prospect, at a position which has seen a surge in demand.
            AD Mitchell is exactly what the Colts look for as he had a fantastic combine and will fill the field stretching role. 
            The Seahawks desperately needed interior line help and Christian Haynes is a strong run-blocking guard who should have been gone by this point.

        <p>
            2020 draft selections, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell, each signed 4 year contracts at $120M and $112M respectively today.   
            Both engines of the lions offense had their best season in 2023 and Brad Holmes certainly wanted to sign them sooner rather than later.
            $77 of St. Brown's contract is guaranteed, who is one of the leagues best slot receivers and had the 3rd most yards(1,515) and receptions(119).
            Sewell received $85 million guaranteed after taking another step up this year, especially as a run blocker, with a 93.1 run blocking grade according to PFF.
