                        MCcarthy had accurate impactful 3rd down passes when needed, but still never had to carry the offense the way many other QB's did.

                        The Falcons will almost certainly be the first team to take a defensive player, but whether that's Laiatu Latu or Dallas Turner is still in the air.
                        I went for Latu as he is one of the most techincally proficent edges in the past few years. The Falcons are in win now mode with rookie weapons and an aging Kirk Cousins,
                        and I think Latu will have a bigger impact in his rookie contact, even if the medicals limit his playing time afterwards.
